- Commission Rate Analysis:
  
Are current travel insurance commissions consistent and sustainable, and would standardizing commission rates improve profitability across agencies?
These visuals make it easy to identify agents who may be over-compensated and to understand the differences in commission levels across agencies.
By standardizing commissions at a 30% benchmark and using Power BI to monitor variances in real time, the business can make more confident, efficient decisions.
